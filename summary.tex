\section*{Preview}
Taisto is a 2D first person shooter game. The objective of human players is to ultimately reach level 16. However, the path to gold and glory is bumby and rough and guarded by furious one-eyed monsters, who are not willing to compromise. 

Fortunately to the brave humans, more weapons become available deeper in the dungeons. This plays a significant role in the success of the humans, since monsters are generally known for huge passion for warfare, but not for skilled usage of modern weapons. In other words, \textbf{you} are up to the task of beating an overwhelming number of monsters with a skilled usage of overwhelming weapons. Good luck, fellow.
